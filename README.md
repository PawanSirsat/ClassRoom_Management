# ClassRoom_Management

I developed a web application using JavaScript, CSS, Java, advanced Java, and Servlet technologies for an educational environment.
The application has three user roles: admin, teacher, and student. As an admin, I created a feature-rich admin panel with seven modules,
allowing for easy management of student and teacher information. CRUD operations were implemented for efficient data handling.
Teachers can assign assignments to specific student batches and engage in group chats with them using the application. 
Students can create coding challenges, download assigned assignments, and communicate with teachers through messages.
My project highlights my expertise in JavaScript, CSS, Java, advanced Java, and Servlet technologies.
It demonstrates my ability to build a comprehensive web application that effectively manages student and teacher information, 
facilitates assignment distribution, and promotes seamless communication
